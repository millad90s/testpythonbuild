## Building Windows Executable

### Automatic Build (GitHub Actions)

The Windows executable is automatically built using GitHub Actions when you:
- Push to the main/master branch
- Create a release/tag
- Manually trigger the workflow

The built executable will be available as a downloadable artifact.

### Manual Build (Local)

To build the executable locally on Windows:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the build script:
```bash
python build_exe.py
```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist/` folder:
   - `SystemInfoDashboard.exe` - The main executable
   - `run_system_info.bat` - Easy-to-use batch file
   - `README.txt` - Instructions for end users

### Build Requirements
